	 * Rules
	 * All cardinal directions are viable. Diagonals are not recommended for this level. All side notes should be treated as forehand hits.
	 * Notes should mostly lie in the bottom row. Use the middle row as a flourish for emphasis. Use the top row sparingly with dot notes only.
	 * Keep red notes primarily on the left side and blue on the right. Avoid crossovers entirely.
	 * Knock yourself out with parity breaks. Players will reset after every hit.
	 * Avoid inverted doubles. Sliders and stacks are not recommended.
	 * If obstacles are used, they should be easy to avoid with no simultaneous notes
