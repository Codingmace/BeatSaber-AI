	 * Rules
	 * @param args
	 * All cardinal directions are viable. Occasional diagonals are fine, but give plenty of time to react and recover.
	 * All note positions viable here in any proportion. Top row notes are fine, but make sure the spacing is not tiring for the player.
	 * Any color, any lane is fine. Always provide enough reaction time before a true crossover where the player’s arms have to physically cross over each other.
	 * Flow is critical unless you have an extended break. Try to cross the parity line with every swing.
	 * Most emphasis options are available, including inverted doubles with sabers going opposite directions. Stacks and sliders are fine, but keep them two notes long and don’t overuse them.
	 * All obstacles are fair game, but be wary about creating vision blocks.
