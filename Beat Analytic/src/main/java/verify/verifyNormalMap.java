	/** 
	 * Rules
	 * All cardinal directions are viable. Diagonals are not recommended for this level. All side notes should be treated as forehand hits.
	 * Notes should lie mostly in the bottom row. Use the middle row as a flourish for emphasis. Use the top row sparingly with dot notes only.
	 * Keep red notes primarily on the left side and blue on the right. Avoid crossovers entirely.
	 * Players will tend to reset after every hit, but you can introduce flow when the notes are too close together.
	 * Inverted doubles are manageable, but don't overuse them. Stacks and sliders should be scarce.
	 * If obstacles are used, they should be easy to avoid. You can sprinkle in notes simultaneously, but give plenty of time to react and recover.
