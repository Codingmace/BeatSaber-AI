	 * All note directions are viable here in any proportion.
	 * All note positions viable here in any proportion. For patterns of wider spacing, give them enough reaction time and be mindful of the player’s stamina.
	 * Any color, any lane is fine. Crossovers should be used wisely and not combined with other weird patterns.
	 * Flow is critical. Parity will make or break your map.
	 * All emphasis options are on the table, including stacks and sliders.
	 * All obstacles are fair game, but be wary about creating vision blocks.
