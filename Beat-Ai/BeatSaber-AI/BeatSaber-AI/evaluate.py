# TODO
# Read in the file and find bad patterns
# Get the score I would give it
# Maybe suggest to change parts of it
# Basically an Evaluate is also needed but too lazy to do that right now
# Clean offset (Shorten if too long or create one if the song starts immediately)
# Determine if variable BPM (Rarely does this come up)
# Documentation for the standards I found
